While building my Javascript and Rails portfolio project, I learned an important lesson about the process of web development. Breaking a project up into smaller pieces, then focusing on those deliverables makes it easier to write code that works. It may not be pretty at first, but the code will work. You can always improve it later. 

While working on my last two projects, I attempted to build a perfect app from the very beginning. Attempting to integrate everything together the first go around, instead of building a working prototype and refactoring later. This caused me to stall. I was focusing on solving to many problems at once, so when something broke, I had no idea what part of the app caused the issue. I was building horizontally. Developing all of my desired functionality concurrently.

During the development of my latest project, I took a different approach. In one of the prep lessons, we were taught to build vertically. Focus on building functionality for one piece of the app, instead of the entire thing. If I had to refactor the add more functionality later, so be it. I was not stalled by thinking about all of the problems that I would have to solve later, instead of just solving the problem that I was working on in the moment. Building vertically completely changed my development process. I refactored code more often, but I finished my project in less time. Probably because I spent less time pondering how to fix an issue that did not even exist yet, and more time actually writing code.
