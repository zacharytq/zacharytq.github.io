Comparisons between the human brain and computer, and the metaphors that have come from them, were inevitable. Are the metaphors imprecise and often wrong following even cursory examination? Yes. Is that gonna stop me from making one?

Random access memory (RAM) is a computer's working memory. The data stored in RAM can be read or changed in any order, with little difference in read or write speeds between discrete locations, making RAM the perfect working memory for a computer. But with all this speed comes a tradeoff: RAM is volatile memory. When the process sustaining the memory stops, or power is cut, the data that was stored is lost. 

Our short term memory behaves a lot like RAM, giving a place to hold data and ideas for the task at hand. And it comes with the same shortcomings. Ideas and thoughts can be lost if we don't actively try to maintain them. On the computer we need only save our file to move our data to a more permanant storage. And this is where our brain differs from a computer. There is no sure way to save memories or ideas.

Of course, there are strategies that we can employ to help our brains remember. While working on my first project I used comments in my code and left sticky notes on my laptop to help refresh my memory after a break from work. Having a strong plan before even starting to code also helped.
